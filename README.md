# CLEXP Module for working with CL Expense Forms

This is a short script for aiding in creating expense statement forms for the computer lab.

Before you start, create a file in your working directory called `_config.yaml`

It should be of the following form

```
title: # e.g. Professor, Dr etc
name: # Your full name
grant_code: # Grant code starting with GXXXX
four_digits: # Last four digits of your bank account number
payroll: # Your eight digit payrole reference number
```
